## About the Game
FishTricks is a unique and fun game that takes inspiration from classic skating games, but with a twist: instead of skating, players control a fish that glides through the water, performing all sorts of flips and spins. The game is set in an open-world environment and features a variety of interesting obstacles to jump over, such as rocks and waterfalls.

As you play, you can collect fish tokens scattered throughout the game world. While these tokens do not unlock new tricks or abilities, they serve as a fun collectible and provide a little extra challenge as you try to collect them all.

One of the most exciting features of FishTricks is the giant cannon that players can use to launch themselves through the air. With a little practice, you can learn to use the cannon to perform all sorts of crazy stunts and maneuvers, including combo flips and spins. And with the game's feedback of each custom trick you perform, every trick feels incredibly realistic and satisfying.

Overall, FishTricks is a fast-paced and exciting game that's perfect for anyone who loves action or skating games or just having fun in an open environment. With its unique setting, impressive graphics, and endless array of tricks and challenges to master.
